# :green_circle: Some Ricks and Some Mortys

## :book: Overview

This is a frontend-only webpage created using React. It makes a simple API call to the Rick and Morty API and displays some selected data to the user.

## :gear: Functionality

The webpage allows users to like the characters or delete them.

## :bust_in_silhouette: Author

The webpage was created by Kanan Garayev, who used this project as his first quick practice using React. This was an opportunity for him to gain in-depth knowledge of Object-Oriented React, understand its fundamentals, and push himself beyond his previous programming experience.

## :art: Styling

The webpage is very simple but fully responsive and works on all devices. The CSS was built from scratch, without using any external libraries or frameworks.
